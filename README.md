Lifting Line model for a wind turbine with visualizing the associated frozen vortex wake. The implemented model uses the polars of the DU95-W-180 airfoil for the wind turbine blades and a geometry of an
optimized turbine obtained by the code of Assignment 1 as mentioned earlier. The model is used to simulate a single rotor as well as two side by side rotors.
