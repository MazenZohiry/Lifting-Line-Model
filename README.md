# Lifting-Line-Model

The Lifting Line Method (LLM) is a method used to detemine the performance parameters of a rotor by taking into account physical phenomena such as induced velocities by resolving the vortices shed at the root and the tip of the blades convecting downstream with the flow. The LLM does that by assigning a horseshoe vortex to each blade element travelling with the flow and together formulating a helical structure representing the frozen wake. The implemented model uses the polars of the DU95-W-180 airfoil to construct a three-blade wind turbine. The model is capable of simuting a single uninstalled rotor as well as two side-by-side rotors.
